This is only a prototype of a Reverse-Shell, 
it was not created for attacks of any kind.
To run the program clone the repo.
In the directory where there is clone,
type the command 
"make Reverse-Shell/ReverseShell/src/ReverseShell", 
then run it as 
"Reverse-shell/ReverseShell/src/ReverseShell",
type the port and open telnet from
the shell of a another device. 
It is strongly advised not to use 
the sudo command in telnet, 
if you want to run Reverse-Shell as root 
type the first command with sudo at the beginning.
